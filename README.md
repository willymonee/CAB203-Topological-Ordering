# CAB203-Topological-Ordering
Given the list of parts and robots, the engineer has requested for an arrangement of the robots on the assembly line such that the widgets are properly assembled with all parts attached or determining that it is not possible to do. This was done through finding a topological ordering after producing the necessary edges and vertices of a directed acyclical graph.
